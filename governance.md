### Governance

The governance structure of the Protocol Client is arranged so that it offers cross-support to all its staff. And so that it can accommodate growth and expansion as the sector grows to absorb and strengthen sections of the global financial system.


Developers and Professionals need a supporting framework and we provide that to our team. We understand that developers are best when they are allowed to develop, and when other professionals from other sectors of the global integrated world take lead in their own specialized fields.

Below is the starting framework of the Protocol Client, as the sector and ourselves grow we leave room for expansion in governance to continue to build a supporting framework that keeps our project from failing to any one source.
