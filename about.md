When Satoshi Nakamoto released Bitcoin to the world, he was very clear that “the nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1.0 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.” Inherent to this statement is the fundamental idea that the economic incentives inherent to the protocol were designed to scale Bitcoin.

We acknowledge that Bitcoin itself is an economic system that uses cryptography to create the world’s first peer to peer electronic currency that doesn’t rely on a trusted third party. Once the protocol is restored we will be a part of the Foundation that Sets it in Stone.

Throughout Bitcoin’s history, we have seen developers attempt to solve perceived security vulnerabilities in Bitcoin that are completely removed from the economics of the system. These perceived security vulnerabilities have been used to spread the myth that Bitcoin is an inherently non-scalable network.

We at the Protocol Client believe Satoshi Nakamoto has created a battle-tested protocol that has yet to show vulnerabilities.

The Protocol Client is committed to assist miners in removing the block size cap entirely and not making any changes to the economic incentives of the system while removing the scale ceiling set in Bitcoin by later developers that did not understand Satoshi’s vision.

After returning to the original 0.1.0 protocol the Protocol client will branch out towards business clients and individual (hobbyists) clients. Adding new features and functionalities that work on top of the Protocol layer, providing users with the Professional tools they need to give them an edge.

Alongside our development releases, the Protocol Client is committed to training developers and releasing educational material to help businesses, developers, users and miners better understand Bitcoin and how the Protocol Client enables the economic incentives of the system to emerge and be leveraged for yours and everyone’s benefit.
