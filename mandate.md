### PROTOCOL CLIENT
The Protocol Client is an implementation of the Bitcoin(link pdf) software.

### PRIORITIES
We will be doing our part in restoring Bitcoin to its original road map as per Satoshi’s vision. And then we will be locking it down and building upwards, and then rendering further services to the sectors Miners, Businesses and Hobbyists.

### TRAINING & EDUCATION
After we have established ourselves in the sector we will be accepting, organizing and taking part in developer education and training programmes globally.
We will establish branches of expertise in client development, using advanced methods to provide the market with clearly defined Mining clients, Business clients, and Hobbyist clients provided with specialized functions allowing the user, whether a Miner, Business, or Hobbyist, to use their Protocol Client to the fullest of their ability.

While keeping our main focus on serving the sector and Bitcoin by keeping Miners as our priority.

### PUBLIC RELATIONS
Will enable and maintain strong communications with the Miner community. And alongside the Protocol Client site, and an extension to communication with the miners, the Public Relations will enable communication with businesses and the wider community when necessary.

### LONG TERM
Through this multi-tiered collaborative effort with those invested in the sector we will do our part in professionalizing this sector, helping train, educate and support new developers. And encourage the adoption and growth of Bitcoin as the One True Global peer-2-peer Electronic Cash.

We will be communicating and working with other Implementations that adhere to Satoshi’s Vision so that the economics and code is maintained while at the same time competing in the extras specialities that can be offered to participants in the market.
